# *Limit Manual*
*Limit Manual* is a Flask application that aims to provide resources and information related to Final Fantasy VII.

Various sites offer a wealth of information about Final Fantasy VII, but due to limitations of the site format or the intention of the authors, have one or more of the following qualities:

* Strong Focus on plot content (spoilers difficult to avoid when searching for specific info)
* Limited searching and sorting functionality (especially outside of weapons and armor)
* Lack of analytical and graphical tools
* Non-standardized markup and styling
* Irregular, difficult to traverse, non-meaningful document structure
* Flat site hierarchy (e.g. the page for a specific character and the page for all characters have the same URL depth)

Plaintext guides also exist that score worse in almost all of these categories when compared to markup documents, but remain a prominent source for in-depth mechanical explanation and (my heart goes out to the writers of these seemingly hand-written) collections of game data relating to their topics.

The goal for *Limit Manual* is to make a site that addresses all of the above.
